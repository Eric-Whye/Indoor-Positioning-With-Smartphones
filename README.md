# Indoor Positioning With Smartphones

Final Year Project where the aim is to apply techniques to achieve viable indoor positioning (In the UCD O'Brien Science Centre) using a smartphone

The Core Objectives of the project are:

Using Wifi fingerprinting to estimate the phones location

Using the phone's inertial sensors to detect steps taken by the user as a form of Pedestrian Dead Reckoning to aid in tracking

Combining the above in a Particle Filter that has the potential to accurately simulate the user and track their position

InertialGatherer is the android app for gathering data during the online phase

WifiGatherer is the android app fro gathering data during the offline phase

Core is where all the input xml files are with the jupyter notebook file for data processing and the implementation of the particle filter
